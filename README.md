This project applies cloud masking and NDVI analysis using the NOAA CDR VIIRS NDVI dataset (2022–2023) in Google Earth Engine and Google Colab to assess vegetation conditions in Southwestern Nigeria. The workflow involves extracting NDVI, removing cloud and shadow effects using QA bit flags, converting the dataset to Xarray for spatiotemporal analysis, and generating both spatial NDVI composite maps and point-based time-series plots. The processed outputs are intended for scientific visualization and poster presentation, supporting environmental monitoring and vegetation health assessment in the region.
